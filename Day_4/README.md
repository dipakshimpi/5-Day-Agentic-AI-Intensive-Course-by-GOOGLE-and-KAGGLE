# 🚀 Day 4 – Agent Observability & Evaluation (Google AI Agents Intensive Course)

This repository contains my learnings and hands-on work from **Day 4** of the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google**.  
The focus of the day was on making AI agents **observable**, **debuggable**, and **evaluatable** — ensuring their behavior aligns with user intent and system goals.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔍 1. Agent Observability
- **Observability** means tracking what’s happening inside your AI agent.
- Learned how to:
  - Capture **agent traces**, logs, and reasoning steps.
  - Use **LangSmith / Weights & Biases** for real-time tracking.
  - Analyze **tool usage**, **API latency**, and **decision reasoning**.
  - Visualize agent execution flow to debug unexpected behaviors.
- Helps answer:
  - Why did my agent choose a specific action?
  - Where is my pipeline slowing down?
  - How can I improve agent reliability?

### 🧪 2. Agent Evaluation
- Evaluation ensures that agents perform **consistently and correctly**.
- Explored:
  - **Human-in-the-loop evaluation**
  - **Automated evaluation** using metrics and LLM-based scoring
  - **Regression testing** for agent workflows
  - Comparing outputs against **expected responses** across datasets
- Key metrics:
  - Accuracy, relevance, coherence, safety, and latency.
- Tools & frameworks covered:
  - **LangSmith Evaluators**
  - **OpenAI Evals**
  - **Custom evaluation pipelines**

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **LangChain / LangGraph**
- **LangSmith** (for observability and evals)
- **OpenAI / Gemini APIs**
- **Weights & Biases (W&B)** for metrics visualization

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Observability = “Understand your agent.”
- Evaluation = “Trust your agent.”
- Together, they make agents **production-ready** and **auditable**.
- Continuous monitoring and evaluation are vital for scaling agentic systems safely.

---

## 📚 Next Steps
- Integrate automatic evaluation loops.
- Add alerting on agent anomalies.
- Deploy monitored agents in real-world use cases.
